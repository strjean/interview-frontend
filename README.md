Bellow you'll find the instructions you must complete to successfully pass the test.

May the force be with you.

## What needs to be done

* Be a hacker: find a way to successfully login to the app - hint: no code change needed.
* Be a saviour: fix a bug in the app.  Each time we refresh the page, we're back to the login screen.  Fix it so we stay on the current page.
* Be a builder: add new a page to the app and fetch all photos (/photos) with the same API as the one used for the login.
